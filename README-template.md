## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript (ES6)
- JSON data for activities

### What I learned

I focused on dynamically loading data from a JSON file and updating the UI based on user selections (Daily, Weekly, Monthly). This involved:

- Fetching and parsing local JSON data.
- Dynamically generating activity cards and populating them with current and previous period data.
- Implementing an active state for the time frame buttons.
- Updating the "previous period" text (e.g., "Yesterday", "Last Week", "Last Month") based on the selected timeframe.

### Continued development

In future projects, I'd like to explore:

- Implementing a more robust data management system, possibly using a framework like React or Vue for better state management.
- Adding animations for smoother transitions between timeframes.
- Enhancing accessibility features.
